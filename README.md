# Rulers-of-the-Red-Plane

A vanilla like(hopefully) mod that plans on adding what the imp expansion would have been. Planning on adding some regular items, a new item tier, 1 or 2 elite types, a new stage(probably stage 5), a new final stage and boss, more enemies, and more(?)!

It's overambitious lol

# Items
### White
- Four Dimensional Dagger: Bleed nearby enemies on hit

### Lunar
- Double Sided Sword: Bleed everything on damage taken

# Bugs
Put them on the github or contact me on the modcord or dm(I_Eye#8095)

If you'd like to translate, contact me(I'll do Spanish though)
