# Rulers-of-the-Red-Plane

A vanilla like(hopefully) mod that plans on adding what the imp expansion would have been. Planning on adding some regular items, a new item tier, 1 or 2 elite types, a new stage(probably stage 5), a new final stage and boss, more enemies, and more(?)!
It's overambitious

Items:
White:
Four Dimensional Dagger: Bleed nearby enemies on hit

Lunar:
Double Sided Sword: Bleed everything on damage taken
