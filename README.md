# Rulers-of-the-Red-Plane

A vanilla like(hopefully) mod that plans on adding what the imp expansion would have been. Planning on adding at least 10 regular items, a new item tiers, 1 or 2 elite types, a new stage(possibly alt stage 1 or 5), a new final stage and boss, more enemies, and more(?)!

Items:
Four-DimensionalDagger: 15%(+15%) chance on hit to cause an enemy within 25 meters to bleed
  Indev
