# About

A vanilla like(hopefully) mod that plans on adding what the imp expansion would have been. Planning on adding some regular items, a new item tier, 1 or 2 elite types, a new stage(probably stage 5), a new final stage and boss, more enemies, and more(?)!  
It's overambitious lol  
# Content
Wiki has more detailed information(I'll try my best to update it)  
There are currently 7 items:
- 1 Common, 1 Uncommon, 1 Lunar, and 4 of a new item tier: Sacrificial
There's also one interactable related to Sacrificial items
# Bugs and stuff
Put them on the github or contact me on the modcord or dm(i_eye on discord)
OR just join the discord server: https://discord.gg/Shd63mp4fB    
If you have any feedback on the content too, I'd love to hear it. I don't want too crazy of items. 
 
I can't guarantee that multiplayer will work, as it hasn't been tested    

Sacrifical items are soon to be reworked
# Translation
If you'd like to translate, contact me(I'll do Spanish though)  
- If my translation is bad and you have time, I'd love to hear feedback, I'm not a native Spanish speaker but estoy probando
